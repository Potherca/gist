Example of how to create a pie chart with [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)

Next step is to use [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/index.html) ([first rough draft on jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/potherca/15L50m89/)).

`@TODO:` Split `index.html` into separate files (js, css, json) to make clear how much work goes into which layer (definition, styling, logic).
