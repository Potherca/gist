This gist displays a map of the 12 provinces the country of the Netherlands contains.

The path in the SVG have province names as class names, making it very easy to style them from a separate CSS file.

This work is based on [an original SVG from the Wikipedia](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Provinces_of_the_Netherlands.svg)

Could be improved upon further by grouping separate path in `<g>` blocks like upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands.svg has.
