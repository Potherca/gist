Pick a fight with the PHPHOOLIGANS!

Talk abstract
----------------
You've read all the popular books, you've listened to all the talks, you *know* how to write quality code!

The PHPHOOLIGANS are here to inform you that everything you think you know is wrong.

The PHPHOOLIGANS (Ben Peachey and Auke van Slooten) are  outspoken fans of the PHP language but with a slightly different opinion on how things should be done.

During this session the PHPHOOLIGANS will engage the audience in a discussion about most things PHP developers get wrong on a daily basis.

Topics of discussion include, but are not limited to: 

 - Using objects (you know you shouldn't)
 - Type safe comparison and type hinting (why bother?)
 - Design Patterns (usually A Bad Idea)
 - PHP Frameworks (not needed, PHP *is* the framework)

Heckling, cheering, booing, it is all allowed in this lively debate, as long as you try to participate.

An official referee will be present to award points to the PHPHOOLIGANS or the audience for valid arguments during this debate.

Game on!
