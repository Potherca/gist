There is a post going round on facebook of a mug with some code on it.

There's even [a reddit post on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/3xdikm/does_anybody_know_where_i_can_find_this_mug/?st=itrfyyvi&sh=e8448c85).
The mug looks quite nice but sadly the code on it is crap.

- The object oriÃ«nted style abstraction
  - There is no container for the coffee
  - There is no dispenser for the cofee
  - There is no person to drink the coffee
- The code style is disappointing
- The comment is totally useless
- There are flaws in the logic
  - When the `coffee` is refilled it is not drunk
  - The logic is only run once
- There is no logging, error handling or messaging

Honestly, if I came across such code in a peer review it would not pass.

At a certain point I might feel like writing a better version.

Right now, my coffee mug is empty, so I'm going to get a refil first ;-)
