<h2>
	The standard button
</h2>

<p>
	Although the technology and philosophy behind the 'Deploy to Heroku' Button are quite awesome, the default look may not what you want.
</p>
<p>
	For one thing there is a distinct difference between the PNG and SVG versions Heroku has on offer.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>PNG format</dt>
	<dd><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png" /></dd>
	<dt>SVG format</dt>
	<dd><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" /></dd>
</dl>

<p>
	Which means you have to choose between "looks good" and "Retina Ready".
</p>
<p>
	Beyond that... the shape, form or size might break with the look and feel of your site or README file.
</p>
<p>
	Or maybe, if you're a bit like me, you dislike the fact that you can't just use a service provider you already use for other services anyway.
</p>

<h2>Using a <a href="	//shields.io">Shields.io</a> button</h2>
<p>
	As shield.io already offers a decent ammount of badges for various service providers, it might be nice to use the same style for your deploy button.
	The only real down-side is that the button will not contain the nice little icon. We could just use an "up arrow" instead.
</p>
<p>
Shields.io offers 3 flavours of styles you can choose from...
