 Popular Coding Convention in PHP on Github
==============================================

For everyone's entertainment I though it might be nice to get PHP added to the [Popular Coding Convention on Github][3] site.

A request [had already been made][1] so I decided to [pick up the gauntlet][2].

My plan of attack is as follows:

1. make a list of all the coding style conventions the different PHP factions tend to squabble or complain about
2. Add code examples explaining the different possible variations
3. Solicit feedback from a few more renowned (or opinionated) community members with the aid of semaphores, tin-can-phone or smoke signals. Or twitter if my wife still won't let me play with matches.
4. Edit the text to reflect various contributions
5. ...
6. Profit!


 Step 1 - Compose as list 
----------------------------------------------

The best place to go to find out which coding style clashes we as a community have seemed to me to be the FIG site. Based on the PSR-1 and PSR-2 I came up with the list below.


 Step 2 - Add examples
----------------------------------------------

This will have to wait for the weekend, I'm afraid. 


 Step 3 - Feedback
----------------------------------------------

The first people that come to mind, other than my co-hooligans are @skoop, @jaytaph, @mvriel, @rdohms, @dr4goonis and maybe @philsturgeon


 Step 4 - Final Edits
----------------------------------------------

Once the dust has settled, the conclusions will be summarized here (so I don't forget which changes to make).


 Step 5 - ...
----------------------------------------------

Ellipsis!


 Step 6 - Profit!
----------------------------------------------

Or just have some more fun, maybe?
