 Popular Coding Convention in PHP on Github
==============================================

For everyone's entertainment I though it might be nice to get PHP added to the 
[Popular Coding Convention on Github][3] site.

A request [had already been made][1] so I decided to [pick up the gauntlet][2].

My plan of attack is as follows:

1. <del>make a list of all the coding style conventions the different PHP factions 
   tend to squabble or complain about</del>
2. <del>Add code examples explaining the different possible variations</del>
3. <del>Solicit feedback from a few more renowned (or opinionated) community members 
   with the aid of semaphores, tin-can-phone or smoke signals. Or twitter if my 
   wife still won't let me play with matches.</del>
4. <del>Edit the text to reflect various contributions</del>
5. ...
6. Profit!


*[UPDATE]*:

After creating a list based on the PSR2 I began to get this feeling of 
uncertainty that it might be incomplete. It was also unclear from the PSR2 alone 
where conflicts would arise with other conventions. So rather than to just guess 
and hope for the best I decided to [take several coding standards and map their 
conventions][4] and that way I would have an actual basis in fact for my set of 
possible convention conflicts. I got a bit _too_ obsessed with the detail for a 
while there, causing some delay. Various [yaks][5] needed [shaving][6] an I 
changed jobs during that period as well, but I got my act together in the end.

 <del>Step 1</del> - Compose as list 
----------------------------------------------

The best place to go to find out which coding style clashes we as a community 
have seemed to me to be the FIG site. Based on the PSR-1 and PSR-2 I came up 
with the list below.


 <del>Step 2</del> - Add examples
----------------------------------------------

Several weekendends later, my list sort of turned into [a side project][4] in 
it's own right but putting it all back together and drawing it back into the 
scope of this project, it looks complete.


 <del>Step 3 - Feedback</del>
----------------------------------------------

The first people that come to mind, other than my co-hooligans are [@skoop][7], 
[@jaytaph][8], [@mvriel][9], [@rdohms][10], [@dr4goonis][11] and maybe 
[@philsturgeon][12]. 


 Step 4 - <del>Final Edits</del>
----------------------------------------------

From the feedback I received it would seem nothing is missing, so all is good!


 Step 5 - ...
----------------------------------------------

Ellipsis!


 Step 6 - Profit!
----------------------------------------------

Or just have some more fun, maybe? In either case, the information here seems complete and is ready for use.
