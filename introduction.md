 Popular Coding Convention in PHP on Github
==================================

For everyone's entertainment I though it might be nice to get PHP added to the http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention/ site.

A request had already been made so I decided to pick up the gauntlet (details at https://github.com/outsideris/popularconvention/issues/25).

My plan of attack is as follows:

1. make a list of all the coding style conventions the different PHP factions tend to squabble or complain about
2. Add code examples explaining the different possible variations
3. Solicit feedback from a few more renowned (or opinionated) community members with the aid of semaphores, tin-can-phone or smoke signals. Or twitter if my wife still won't let me play with matches.
4. Edit the text to reflect various contributions
5 ...
6. Profit!

 Step 1
------------
The best place to go to find out which coding style clashes we as a community have seemed to me to be the FIG site. Based on the PSR-1 and PSR-2 I came up with the list below.

 Step 2

This will have to wait for the weekend, I'm afraid.
