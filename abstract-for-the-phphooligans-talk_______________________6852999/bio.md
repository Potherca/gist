Ben Peachey and Auke van Slooten have both been programming in PHP for more than ten years and are 2 of the 3 founding members of the PHPTwente usergroup.

It was during a discussion at on of the PHPTwente meetups that the idea for the PHPHOOLIGANS was born: outspoken fans of the PHP language. 

Everybody knows code but the PHPHOOLIGANS know better!
