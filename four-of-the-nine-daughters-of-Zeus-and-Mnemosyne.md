            Choral poetry evolved in ancient Greece from lyric poetry (poetry 
            written to music). It was originally performed with musical 
            accompaniment at religious festivals and important family functions. 
            Traditional choral poetry was performed by two groups of people who 
            worked as a team to design, write, and musically perform an 
            expressive poem. Modern choral poetry can be written to express 
            feelings, opinions, points of view, etc. The poems are generally 
            short and designed to be read aloud by two or more people in a group 
            setting. Additionally, choral poetry can be adapted and performed 
            using existing poetry and stories (in the public domain), such as 
            select fables and nursery rhymes.
