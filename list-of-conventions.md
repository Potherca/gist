The following list contains all of the conventions I can think of to include in 
the convention list. It is based on a comparison of various conventions as 
dictated by various more well-know projects.

Some of these may be dropped under influence of comments or lack of good 
examples.


Whitespace
----------------------------------------------
 - Brace Placement (Class/Control Structures/Methods)
 - File Encoding
 - Indentation (general/switch)
 - Line Endings
 - Line Length (hard limit/soft Limit)
 - Space (Control Structure Brackets/Around Param Block/Method Declaration Inside Param Block)


Naming Convention
----------------------------------------------
 - Class Names
 - Class Constant Names
 - Class Method Names
 - Class Variable Names
 - Constant Names
 - Function Names
 - Namespace Usage
 - PHP Constants Casing
 - PHP Keyword Casing

Other
----------------------------------------------
 - Method Declare Order
 - Dockblocks
 - Error Level
 - Closing Tags
 - Short Tags (general/echo)
 - Always use Control braces

 Castaways and Cutouts
----------------------------------------------

There are several things mentioned that I don't think fall under "code style 
clash" but rather good/bad practices. I don't think these need to be included. 
Also, various things might be too tricky to measure and should be left out 
because of that.

 - Declaration of global variables and global constants
 - Declaration of Functions
 - Operators and assignment (Yoda Conditions/Left Side Comparison)
 - Inter-line alignment     (Vertical Lining Up Values)
 - Comments and documentation blocks
 - Class name prefixes and suffixes
 - Usage of include_once versus require_once?
 - Usage of underscore '_' for private/protected properties? (PSR explicitly says no, some others explicitly say yes. Could be interesting to see?)
 - Conventions for file names
