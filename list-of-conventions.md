The following list contains all of the conventions I can think of to include in the convention list.
Some of these may be dropped under influence of comments or lack of good examples.

In no particular order:

 Whitespace
----------------------------------------------

 - Indent spaces or tabs
 - Line length
 - Line endings
 - Closing php tag present or not
 - Blank line after `<?php` opening token or not
 - Indentation of case/break from switch
 - Space after Function/Method declaration
 - Space after Class declaration
 - Space after Control declaration

 Line breaks
----------------------------------------------

 - Class brace same or next line
 - Method brace same or next line
 - Control brace same or next line
 - else/elseif same or next line


 Naming Convention
----------------------------------------------

 - Class names
 - Function/Method names
 - Constant names
 - true/false/null lowercase or uppercase


 Misc. (by want of a better name)
----------------------------------------------

 - Declaration of `static` first or visibility `public`/`protected`/`private` first
 - Always use Control braces

 Castaways and Cutouts
----------------------------------------------

There are several things mentioned that I don't think fall under "code style clash" but rather good/bad practices.
I don't intent to include these unless a strong case can be made for 'm.

 - Declaration of global variables and global constants
 - Declaration of Functions
 - Operators and assignment
 - Inter-line alignment
 - Comments and documentation blocks
 - Class name prefixes and suffixes
