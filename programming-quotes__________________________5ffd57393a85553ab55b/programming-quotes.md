<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so
simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it
so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.</p>

Sigh... When it comes to software there are three systems of beliefs.
One of them:

    * Thou shalt know by your heart that all software sucks.
    * Beware of those who say that their software does not suck, for they
      are either fools or liars.
    * Beware of those who give you garments and do not allow to mend them,
      for sooner or later thou shalt find what needs mending.
    * But beware also of those who give you badly rotten garments and say
      "Thou shalt prefer that above everything, for thou art allowed to
      mend it".
    * Thou shalt not treat software as a living being, for it is not one.
    * Choose a license of thine liking for sofware thou writest and do not
      blame those who choose differently for software they write.
    * Know when to say "It can be mended, I shalt do that" and when to
      say "It is rotten beyond repair".
    * Choose free over non-free when it is better or when thou art willing
      to fix what is broken.
    * When shit happens, think how to fix it.

Another:

    * All software wants to be free
    * Thou shalt not use non-free software
    * Thou shalt not mention non-free software
    * Thou shalt make all thine software free
    * Thou shalt choose free above working, even if free one is broken
      beyond repair
    * When shit happens, add new features

and the last one:

    * Our 3133t! K3wl! Software! Does Not Suck!!!
    * Always choose our software above everything else
    * When shit happens, we add new features

If you happen to believe in second variant, you have my condolence as
long as you don't force your beliefs on everybody else. If you choose
to emulate door-to-door pests^H^H^H^Hreachers - don't expect to be
treated differently.

<hr>

<p>People do have a right to put their code under whatever license they like.
Now, <em>I</em> won’t use the stuff I don’t have a source for unless I have
exceptionally good reason to believe that authors of that stuff are
among the few percents of programmers who <em>can</em> find their arse without
outside help.  But that has nothing to do with licensing or any moral
considerations and everything to the fact that I know what kind of crap
most of the software is.</p>

<p>Computer: Your nominators and endorsers for the Kanai Award consistently
characterized your work as simple yet powerful. How do you discover such
powerful abstractions?</p>

<p><a href="http://genius.cat-v.org/ken-thompson/">Ken Thompson</a>: It is the way I think. I am a very bottom-up thinker. If you give
me the right kind of Tinker Toys, I can imagine the building. I can sit there
and see primitives and recognize their power to build structures a half mile
high, if only I had just one more to make it functionally complete. I can see
those kinds of things.</p>

<p>The converse is true, too, I think. I can’t from the building imagine the
Tinker Toys. When I see a top-down description of a system or language that has
infinite libraries described by layers and layers, all I just see is a morass.
I can’t get a feel for it. I can’t understand how the pieces fit; I can’t
understand something presented to me that’s very complex. Maybe I do what I do
because if I built anything more complicated, I couldn’t understand it. I
really must break it down into little pieces.</p>

<p>if you’re capable of understanding `finalised virtual hyperstationary factory

mind with large chunks of complexity, so concurrent programming should be
simple by comparison.  go for it.</p>

<p>At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I
soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be
implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination. There is nothing a
mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million
dollars. But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way -and
that is reliability. The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost
simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay.</p>

<p>Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small
trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you’ll
just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at
that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work
you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don’t think about
some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn’t solve some fairly immediate
need, it’s almost certainly over-designed. And don’t expect people to jump in
and help you. That’s not how these things work. You need to get something
half-way useful first, and then others will say “hey, that almost works for
me”, and they’ll get involved in the project.</p>

<p>Q: What is the most often-overlooked risk in software engineering?</p>

<p>A: Incompetent programmers. There are estimates that the number of programmers
needed in the U.S. exceeds 200,000. This is entirely misleading. It is not a
quantity problem; we have a quality problem. One bad programmer can easily
create two new jobs a year. Hiring more bad programmers will just increase our
perceived need for them. If we had more good programmers, and could easily
identify them, we would need fewer, not more.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well over half of the time you spend working on a project (on the order of 70
percent) is spent thinking, and no tool, no matter how advanced, can think for
you. Consequently, even if a tool did everything except the thinking for you –
if it wrote 100 percent of the code, wrote 100 percent of the documentation,
did 100 percent of the testing, burned the CD-ROMs, put them in boxes, and
mailed them to your customers – the best you could hope for would be a 30
percent improvement in productivity. In order to do better than that, you have
to change the way you think.</p>

<p>The comment about developers making work for themselves is also spot on. I
answer a lot of programming questions, and the questions are always asked
because the programmer has reached the end of a twisty maze of his own
creation. Turn around, walk, spin around, and try again. You’ll find a better
solution.</p>

<p>a program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet
people talk about programming as if it were a production  process and measure
“programmer productivity"in terms of "number of lines of code produced”.In so
doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always
refer to"the number of lines of code spent".</p>

<p>it’s an old observation that in order to be useful hypothesis has to be
falsifiable.  Similar principle applies to design proposals - to be worth of
any attention they have to be detailed enough to allow meaningful criticism.</p>

<p>What you have done so far is equivalent to coming to a hospital and saying
“aseptic good, infection bad”.  That would get pretty much the same reactions,
varying from “yes, we know” to “do you have any specific suggestions?” and
“stop wasting our time”[1].</p>

<p>In short: get lost and do not come back until you have something less
vague.</p>

<p>The beauty of small and simple code is that you can bend or break the rules as
long it stays small and simple. Rules allow people to write code without
thinking.  [And when] you dont think […] you get bloated code that just
