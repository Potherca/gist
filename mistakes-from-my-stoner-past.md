In my younger days, as many a teenager in the Netherlands in the ninties, I used to occasionally smoke [marijuana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)), otherwise known as "pot"

In the early days of the internet, having _one_ handle wan't really a thing, other than on [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and [ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ)
(Yes, I _was_ already online in 1996, thanks for noticing). I, like most people, would use different names in different places. 

Most sites would, also, not tell you which constraints they placed on user-names.

One fateful afternoon, I was creating an account somewhere... It could have been [Bolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt.com) or [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) or something...

Anyway, playing around with words, I had typed in the username `pot her cannabis`. As it turns out, the place did not accept user-names with more than 8 characters. And it did not accept spaces in user-names. It also did not tell me this.

It just stripped the whitespace and cut the input off after the eight character, leaving me with the username `potherca`.

It looked cool enough, so I stuck with it for a while. I started using other handles less and less, and it's been with me ever since.
